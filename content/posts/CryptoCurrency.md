# Project

Amidst our mid semester break, came the news of the international breakout of the Corona Virus. <br>
Many of us were wasting their time in useless activites. Soon the SnT Council announced the Summer <br>
Projects of various clubs and societies. I chose Advanced Competitve Programming and Block Chain.<br>
We leave the first for another time.<br>

In the beginning I started coding in Python , the simple mining assignment that were given to us <br>
as subtasks. However, slowly I realised I must choose a Language and stick. I felt an innate dispositon<br>
to Java. Java;s rigid structure appeals to me more than the structure of python. It just is amazing to code<br>
and implement OOP programs in. The project lasted for around 3 months and taught me a lot of things. <br>

1. It is diffcult to implement RSA PSS Signature in Java (One must use external   BouncyCastle Dependecy.)
1. Concurrency causes a lot of problems in case of shared data.
1. Multithreading is a very deep and interesting topic.
1. Synchronized keyword usage in Java to lock variables while changing them.
1. I learnt how to implement a Http Server in Java and use it to do almost anything that I want
1. I learnt to use ngrok to tunnel myself to the internet.
1. Real meaning of throw, throws, try and catch
1. Also learned how to make a maven jar of a Java Project with a particular main class and all dependecies in the jar included.
1. Learned how to delete folder on a github project.
1. I leanrnt a lot about Block Chains and how they function.
